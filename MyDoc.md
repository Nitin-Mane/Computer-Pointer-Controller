I'm not able to run the inference on the CPU and GPU as due to the processor generation issue. I have 2nd generation i3 processor which is not supporting to the OpenVINO toolkit. 

I enrounter with many errors there i have to moved to myriad VPU option. 

Please consider the situtaion and the time limitation i'm able to provide the necessary results which was applicable but the vtune and Intel DevCloud for benchmark has some issue for evaulating the result. I have mentioned the outcome of the Myriad device results and process as the final outcome.
